>Notice the math seems "wrong"? There are no fractions, only whole numbers. 
You need to use a "floating point" number, which is a number with a decimal point, 
as in 10.5, or 0.89, or even 3.0.

This is beacouse when you are using whole numbers there can be no remander.   
If want to by 5 movies that are 10 dollars a piece but you only have 45 dollars.  
You can not buy 4 1/2 movies.
