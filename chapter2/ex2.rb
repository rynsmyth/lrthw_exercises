# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by ruby.

puts 'I could have code like this.' # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# puts "This won't run."

# Study Drills

# 1) Find out if you were right about what the # character does and
# make sure you know what it's called (octothorpe or pound character).

# I double checked that the # symbol will comment out a line.
# I did not know that you should have a space after the # symbol.

# 2) Take your ex2.rb file and review each line going backward. Start
# at the last line, and check each word in reverse against what you
# should have typed.

# The only errors I found is to not use "". You should use ''.

# 3) Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.

# I did not find anymore mistakes.

# 4)Read what you typed above out loud, including saying each
# character by its name. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.

# I did not find any mistakes.
