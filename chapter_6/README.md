###Find all the places where a string is put inside a string. There are four places.
```ruby       
y = "Those who know #{binary} and those who #{do_not}."
             
puts "I said: #{x}."   

puts "I also said: '#{y}'."    
```

####There is only 3 places. The variable `hilarious` is a boolean

`joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! #{hilarious}"`

###Are you sure there are only four places? How do you know? Maybe I like lying.

There are only 3 places   

###Explain why adding the two strings w and e with + makes a longer string.

When you add two strings together it is called concatenating string.  

###What happens when you change the strings to use ' (single-quote) instead of " (double-quote)? 
###Do they still work? Try to guess why.

If you use single-quotes instead of double-quotes ruby will not evaluate the the string.   
Double-quotes are used for string interpolation and for escape single-quotes in a string.
