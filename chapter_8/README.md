>###Do you like string interpolation or format strings? Why?

After using both interpolation and formatting strings with a hash map. I would have to say I like both.</br>
I like the intial simplicity of interpolation but I can see the benefits of formatting strings with a hash map.</br>
With formatting your strings you can have a more consitent representation of your data.
